## Project

The project consists on a series of Jupyter notebooks in Python, focused on glacier mass balance modelling using different types of 
regression methods. Data is extracted using the [Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM)](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm), providing climate, topographical and 
mass balance data for almost any glacier on Earth. The project is focused on all glaciers in Scandinavia, with the goal
of learning multi-annual mass balance changes from [the Hugonnet et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03436-z ) 
geodetic mass balance paper. We cover two of the most popular machine learning libraries for beginners: 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
