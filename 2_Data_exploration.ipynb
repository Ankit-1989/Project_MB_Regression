    "The first question we should ask ouselves is: what variables affect the physical process we are trying to model here? In this case, we are talking about **glacier-wide mass balance**. Theory tells us that the integrated mass balance over the whole surface area of a glacier is impacted by both the climate and the topography of a glacier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike point mass balance, the hypsometry of a glacier has a great impact on its glacier-wide mass balance. This is mainly manifested in two ways:\n",
    "- The glacier surface slope affects ice flow dynamics, particularly the creep component. Generally, steeper glaciers have higher ice velocities, which imply a faster transfer of ice from the higher altitudes in the accumulation area to the lower altitudes in the ablation area. Therefore, a steep glacier will retreat faster (i.e. smaller surface area and higher mean altitude), but it will be able to move to higher altiudes with a colder climate. This helps the glacier find new colder climates in an effort to reach equilibrium. On the other hand, flatter glaciers and ice caps will not retreate as fast, since they react mostly through thinning (see Figure). This means that the glacier will move to lower altitudes with a warmer climate, further enhancing melt. This has an opposite effect to the one from steep mountain glaciers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Steep mountain glaciers have a wider altitudinal range, meaning that they mass balance gradient will be higher and more complex. On the other hand, ice caps behave more similar to an ice cube: the reduced role of ice dynamics and their small altitudinal range imply a more homogenous mass balance gradient.\n",
