    "When training and testing a model, we usually split the dataset among three different sets: training, validation and testing set. Sometimes, this split of the data is done authomatically by the method we use, and sometimes instead of a simple split of the dataset into three pieces is done iteratively (eg, in k-fold cross-validation). Independently of how we implement this, we need to understand the limitations and considerations we need to have at the moment we do the split. This considerations can include:\n",
